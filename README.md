# Navbar

This is a Responsive Navbar designed with a modern and minimalistic approach. The navbar includes the following features:
Fixed Positioning: The header remains at the top while scrolling.
Smooth Blur Effect: A translucent background with a blur effect enhances aesthetics.
Responsive Design:
On larger screens, the navbar items are displayed in a row.
On smaller screens (below 768px), a menu icon appears, and clicking it reveals a sliding menu.
The menu width is reduced to 40% for a more compact appearance.
Smooth Transitions: The menu slides in and out with an animation for a sleek effect.
Active State Indication: The current active section is highlighted.
Auto-close on Selection: On mobile, selecting a menu item automatically closes the menu for a seamless experience.
This navbar provides an elegant and efficient navigation solution for any modern website. ðŸš€
